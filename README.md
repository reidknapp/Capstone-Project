# Capstone-Project-Scripts

For my senior project I developed a parking monitoring system for Union College campus.

There were essentially two parts to this project: 
<p><strong> Parking Sensor Logic </strong>
 The parking sensor logic handled the sensing of a car through two breakbeam sensors,
 as well as the HTTP request to send the information to the server.
</p>
<p><strong> Web Server Scripting:</strong>
 The web server scripting handles the entry of data into the SQL database from the HTTP request
 as well as formats the webpages stored on the webserver.
</p>
